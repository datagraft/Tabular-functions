1,Albania,Northwestern Albania,41348,41376,29,0,2800,,,Heavy Rain,1,,3304.87,,,4.981552378697,19.6182,42.0043,"April 11, 2013: ""OBOT, Albania (AP) -- Villagers in northwestern Albania are running out of patience after their homes have been surrounded by floodwaters for a month.They blame their ills on the operators of major hydropower dams that discharged vast quantities of water to keep levels manageable, and said Thursday the government has done little to ease their plight.""They get millions of euros selling the electricity produced by this water you see in my yard,"" farmer Hil Gjocaj said in Obot village, 120 kilometers (75 miles) northwest of the capital, Tirana. ""But not a cent of that money has come here to protect me and my business from the water.""The 51-year-old pointed in disgust to a water-covered greenhouse. Inside, his pepper plants - in which he has invested about 1,000 euros ($1,300) - lay under waters as placid as a lake's.Submerged orange and lemon groves stand around, while dry pockets that rise above the water here and there are covered in parked cars.A month after heavy rains started, more than 700 houses in the Shkoder district remain surrounded by three feet (about a meter) of floodwater, although their residents stayed on as most buildings are dry inside. About 15,000 acres (6,000 hectares) of land are waterlogged, and rafts or small boats are the only mode of transportation.Obot lies five kilometers (3 miles) from the national road. To cover that distance now takes half an hour by small boat. Most of the houses are two-story constructions, many built in the past two decades by returning immigrants - more than 1 million of whom left the impoverished Balkan country after the fall of Communism in 1990, to seek a better future in the west or neighboring Greece.Their choice of a site may not have been the best. The area has experienced severe floods three times in the past four years, and serves as a basin for surrounding regions.
Pellumb Dani, an official at the Shkoder prefecture, said Thursday that the area is prone to flooding whenever there is heavy rain, particularly as the country's three main hydropower stations that cover 95 percent of domestic electricity needs are built on the nearby Drini River.When it rains a lot, operators are forced to discharge water to lessen the load on dams that could otherwise crack. That goes downstream and floods the surrounding countryside. Dani said the volume of water entering the area in recent days was at times nearly twice as much as can be naturally absorbed or carried away by rivers.But farmers in Obot alleged that power authorities tried to stock up a lot of water in the dams during the summer, and the sheer volume of winter rain took them by surprise, quickly bringing reservoir water to near-dangerous levels.""There has never been flooding in spring,"" 83-year old Pjeter Gjocaj said from a verandah on his water-surrounded house. ""Me and the women have been imprisoned here for a month.""Power company officials weren't immediately available for comment.Authorities have been sending food and drinking water to flood victims, but farmers say their main concern is food for their livestock.""Flooding came at a time when we were to cut the grass (for fodder). Many cows or sheep are on the brink of death,"" said Denard Franja, a farmer who has started a side business as a boatman. ""Authorities have compensated us only for the first floods in 2010. This time they have not come at all.""Regional authorities have promised around 600 tons of fodder imported from Montenegro will arrive in the next few days.",

In Albania, a combination of heavy snow followed by equally heavy rain has caused rivers to burst their banks.The authorities have been forced to discharge water from three hydro-electric power stations after danger levels were reached.Hardest-hit is Albania’s northwest where EU countries have sent boats, pumps and food to help out while 700 Albanian troops have been called up to organise an evacuation of thousands of people trapped in their homes from rising flood waters.The situation is also critical in other parts of the Adriatic hinterland. Central Croatia and parts of Bosnia are struggling where it has been raining for days with little sign of a change in the weather.An artificial lake in Croatia’s Kosinj valley has overflowed and, in some areas, water levels were reported to be rising by eight centimetres an hour.
Local residents are on standby to be evacuated while, nearby, electricity had to be cut off to about 150 homes due to the threat of electric shocks. And, in Bosnia, the situation is worst in the central and southern parts of the country where the impact of torrential rain and flooding is being described as a catastrophe.Some residents are hoping to sit it out, refusing to leave their flooded homes for fear of what might become of their possessions.
 January 6, 2010: ""Tirana - Albania is facing a potential catastrophe after days of heavy rain which have left hundreds of houses flooded in the northwestern areas, Prime Minister Sali Berisha said Wednesday. 'We are in a real emergency situation and a potential catastrophe,' Berisha told reporters in Tirana after an emergency government meeting to discuss urgent evacuation of flooded areas. 'The rain is falling for 10 days. It is our duty to prevent catastrophe, so these areas have to be evacuated,' he said adding that the army is completing evacuation plans. Earlier media reports indicated that a number of villagers from Shkodra area refused to leave their homes fearing they would loose their possessions, and authorities threatening they will be evacuated by force. 'The loss of even one life would be a heavy burden for the country. It is more courageous to find a way to overcome this situations with wisdom,' Berisa said calling the inhabitants of flooded villages to evacuate. 

According to the latest reports over 3800 hectares of land are under water and 350 houses are flooded

The long aftermath of flood recovery will take a heavy toll as well, costing at least 5 billion Kč ($267.4 million), according to Janota, who said flood relief would almost certainly lead to a state deficit of at least 165 billion Kč, or 15 billion Kč more than previous estimates.On June 25, the government announced it would earmark 99 million Kč in flood relief aid to be distributed as soon as possible.

SOFIA, Sept. 6 (Xinhua) -- Floods caused by heavy rains killed at least three people and broke bridges and dams in southeastern Bulgaria on Saturday morning, officials said.

Two victims, women at 69 and 21 years respectively, were drowned in their cars when a huge amount of water flooded the road from Burgas to Sozopol, Burgas municipality said on its website.

Rescue teams found the third victim of the floods, a 27-year-old man, in a caravan near the nearby village of New Panicharevo, the Ministry of Interior said in a press release.

Water also broke two bridges over Ropotamo River and the wall of a dam near Dimitrovgrad, flooded Primorsko airport, and dragged into the sea 50 boats from the fishing village south of Burgas.

On June 20, downpour-triggered floods killed 12 people in the Black Sea Port of Varna, and in late April, a swollen river swept away a car with a four-member family on board in southeastern Bulgaria.""",

The problem is that Cougar helicopters, on which we have spent so much money, are not equipped with any form of anti-icing or de-icing system, which means that there is a huge risk of an engine failure after takeoff. The machines can reach an altitude of no more than 60 meters and cannot fly fast. At altitudes of over 60 meters the temperature is too low and the helicopters could freeze and plummet to the ground,"" Borisov stated.He specified that the risk had nevertheless been taken and the helicopters had already headed for the crisis spot.""We were also about to hit the ground at a certain point"" Borisov noted, confirming that he was also flying to the flood-hit region.""We have spent over BGN 500 000 on helicopters that can only fly in deserts and we can only use them to go to the beach in summertime,"" the Prime Minister said with indignation.An emergency situation was declared in the entire Haskovo municipality after the wall of the Ivanovo dam broke and flooded the village of Biser.Boats with divers of the local Civil Protection unit have already reached the village and over 30 people have been rescued.Meanwhile, the citizens of the southern Bulgarian town of Zlatograd are ready to be evacuated, as the municipalities of Zlatograd and Nedelino are in a state of emergency due to heavy rainfalls and melting snow.

The floods also have disrupted road travel in the area and a few homes have been affected.The extent of the damage in Trikala was minimal yesterday compared to the destruction wreaked by floods in the northern prefecture of Evros, where local authorities remained on standby.More than 20,000 hectares of land have been submerged across the prefecture and dozens of homes have been rendered uninhabitable.Last night, Deputy Citizens’ Protection Minister Spyros Vougias was due to arrive in Alexandroupoli ahead of a scheduled tour of flooded areas today.

Authorities have been forced to close rail bridges in the region.Storms and torrential rains also hit parts of Turkey, particularly the northwest city of Edirne on Saturday. Flooding destroyed farmland and other property and forced roads and bridges to close. Melting snow and heavy rains in the last few days resulted in massive flooding in southern Bulgaria. The Tundzha River overflew its banks and left many homes under water in the southeast city of Yambol, civil defence Agency officials announced on Sunday. Floods destroyed bridges and caused landslides around the town of Elhovo and its surrounding villages, virtually cutting them off from the rest of the country. More rain is forecast this week.

The operation became necessary due to continued flooding of several villages behind the break. It appears to have been successful.The fight against the record floods that have struck Germany over the last two weeks is largely over, with rivers having returned to their banks and clean-up well underway. But in one part of the eastern state of Saxony-Anhalt, the battle continued over the weekend -- and it was one in which authorities were forced to come up with an unorthodox method to plug a breach in an Elbe River dike just east of Berlin.On Saturday, two barges were sunk using explosives at a gap in a levee in an attempt to stop floodwaters from continuing to flow into the countryside. On Sunday, an additional barge was sunk at the site to block up the final 20 meters (66 feet) of the 90 meter breach. Helicopters carrying oversized sandbags and pieces of concrete then filled in around the sunken boats. Officials on Sunday evening said that the gap had been 80 percent sealed as a result of the operation.
The spectacular fix became necessary after the dike gave way last week, flooding several small towns behind the dike and resulting in thousands of people being evacuated. Now that the water has ceased flowing from the swollen Elbe through the gap in the levee, the flooded area behind it has begun to slowly shrink. Still, some 145 square kilometers of land (56 square miles) remain under water.
It was the first time ever in Germany that sunken ships were used to plug a hole in a dike. The barges were carefully maneuvered into place before explosives on board were detonated so as to ground the craft. Then, several helicopters began flying gigantic sacks of sand to the site to prevent the barges from drifting away.""It was an extremely difficult and risky operation,"" Saxony-Anhalt Governor Reiner Haselhoff told German news agency DPA. ""But we had to do something and to try everything in our power to stop the water.""
Captain Thomas Peter, who maneuvered the barges into position, said: ""We'd never done such a thing before. But we're not crazy. We were able to half-way assess the situation.""Elsewhere on the Elbe River on Monday, officials reported that water levels were well down from their peaks and were continuing to drop."" May 23, 2013: ""Worst floods in a decade hit Czech Republic* Six killed in Czech Republic, two dead in Austria* Flooding also affects Germany, Austria, Slovakia* German Chancellor Merkel to visit flooded area* Insurers brace for big compensation payouts By Jason Hovet and Jana Mlcochova. PRAGUE, June 3 (Reuters) - Volunteers piled up sandbags to keep a swollen river from overwhelming the Czech capital's historic centre on Monday after floods across central Europe forced factories to closed, drove thousands from their homes and killed at least eight people.Six people died in the Czech Republic from the worst flooding in a decade and a state of emergency was declared, while in Austria two people died and another two were missing.The flooding, which also affected parts of Germany, Slovakia, Hungary and Poland, sent shares in reinsurers Munich Re and Hannover Re down by about 2.5 percent, with markets anticipating big claims from property owners once the waters recede.The flooding arose from several days of torrential rainfall. In some places two months worth of rain fell in just a few days.Carmaker Volkswagen temporarily shut its plant in Zwickau, in the eastern German state of Saxony, because the flooding stopped workers reaching the factory.In the centre of the west German town of Passau, people took off their shoes and rolled up their trousers to walk through the ankle-deep water.The last time central Europe saw similar floods was in 2002, when 17 people were killed in the Czech Republic, and damage estimated at 20 billion euros ($26 billion) was inflicted.Officials in Prague, the Czech capital listed by the U.N. cultural agency as a World Heritage Site, said they did not anticipate the waters of the Vltava river would reach 2002 levels.But they were taking no chances. They shut the metro system and, in streets near the river, soldiers put up metal fences - the sort of flood defences ordered after the disaster 11 years ago. Elsewhere, volunteers built walls of sandbags.Tigers at Prague zoo were tranquilised and moved out of an enclosure at risk from flooding.Czech officials said the flood defences in Prague should hold, but that the river level was likely to rise again on Tuesday morning. ""The story is not yet over here,"" said Czech Environment Minister Tomas Chalupa.CAFES SUBMERGED The Charles Bridge, a favourite spot for tourists that dates to the 14th century, was closed. Tree trunks floated by in the muddy brown water. A riverside path that is below street level, is usually populated with cyclists and people sitting at cafes, was under water on Monday.
""We left England yesterday and it was sunny and warm. We didn't expect this, we don't even have our raincoats,"" said British tourist Alison Tadman, who came to Prague with her husband, Adrian, to celebrate her 47th birthday.She and her husband were sheltering in a McDonald's restaurant. ""We're pretty disappointed,"" she said.

Some of the worst flooding was around the Danube river, which starts in Germany and winds its way through countries including Austria, Slovakia and Hungary on its way to the Black Sea. The river was swollen by heavy rain at the weekend.In Germany, the interior minister flew to flood-hit regions on Monday and Chancellor Angela Merkel was preparing to go on Tuesday, government spokesman Steffen Seibert said.How her government responds to the emergency could have some bearing on the outcome of a nationwide election in September.Shipping was stopped on parts of the Danube and Rhine rivers in Germany, and along the entire Austrian stretch of the Danube, because of the high waters. The rivers are important arteries for moving grains, coals and other commodities.

Thousands of people living in low-lying areas in Austria and the Czech Republic had to be evacuated from their homes. In the Austrian town of Schaerding, a duck swam across a road intersection, past the gates of a flooded cemetery.The flooding killed five people in the Czech Republic over the weekend and on Monday the death toll went up to six - a worker electrocuted while trying to switch off a flooded electricity transformer 50 km (30 miles) east of Prague, the Czech news agency CTK reported.In the Austrian city of Salzburg, 160 passengers were put up overnight in army barracks after the floods stranded their train. Austrian Foreign Minister Michael Spindelegger told reporters the situation in some areas was ""very fraught.""The risk on Monday was that the flood danger could follow the course of the Danube river downstream to other European countries along its route.Workers erected flood barriers along the banks of the Danube where it passes through the Slovak capital, Bratislava, and police shut several roads.""We are getting bad news from Germany and Austria. We have to do all we can to protect ... the capital,"" Slovak Prime Minister Robert Fico said.In Hungary, whose capital Budapest also sits on the banks of the Danube, state media quoted Gyorgy Bakondi, head of the National Disaster Authority, as saying that 400 people were working on flood defences.He said water levels in the river could reach or even exceed the height seen in the record flooding in 2002.Some climate scientists cited a possible link between extreme weather such as flooding and climate change. The warmer the air, the more moisture it holds. A study last year by a United Nations panel of scientists said heavy rainfalls will become more common in this century. BERLIN — Raging waters from three rivers have flooded large parts of the southeast German city of Passau following days of heavy rainfall in central Europe.A spokesman for the city's crisis center said Monday that the situation was ""extremely dramatic"" and waters are expected to rise further by midday to their level highest in 70 years.
Herbert Zillinger told The Associated Press that much of the city was inaccessible except by boat and electricity supplies have been shut off as a precaution.At least four people have reportedly died and nine are missing due to floods in Germany, Austria, Switzerland and the Czech Republic in recent days.",

Part of the city of Konstanz was inundated and commercial shipping was banned on the Rhine up to the city of Cologne.
DAPD, however, quoted meteorologists in Trier as saying the swelling of the Mosel, a tributary of the Rhine, was not unusual and was likely to pass without causing major damage.""

The three had drowned while trying to carry items from the basement upstairs, a police spokesman said.""Rescue workers sought to clear flood-borne debris including damaged cars and evacuate victims after heavy rains and stormy winds across central Europe killed at least 15 people over the weekend.Heavy downpours yesterday caused rivers to overflow their banks and a dam to burst, submerging Bogatynia and other towns in southwest Poland and killing at least three people.Flood damage and deaths also were reported in neighbouring countries. The death toll in the Czech Republic grew to five today and another three were missing and feared drowned.On Saturday, three people died in the German town of Neukirchen, near the Czech border.In neighbouring Lithuania, falling trees and structures killed four and injured several, with thousands being left without electricity after storm winds hit the country.The army, police and fire-service rescuers were using amphibious vehicles, helicopters and heavy earth-moving equipment to evacuate flood victims and clear debris including damaged cars blocking narrow streets.The weekend deluge followed major spring and summer flooding across Poland, which caused widespread property damage and claimed some two dozen lives.In Germany, authorities at the weekend evacuated some 1,400 people around the town of Goerlitz, on the border with Poland, where they expected the flooding level to rise after topping 7 metres (23 feet).In the Czech Republic, extra rescue personnel and soldiers were called in to help with evacuation from some of the worst affected towns in the north of the country, and helicopters were used to reach villages cut off by the swollen rivers.

Macedonian farmers say the floods have caused tens of millions of euros worth of damage to fertile land and crops.In southern Albania, where the Vjosa River has flooded 18,000 hectares of land and killed thousands of cattle, waters were rising again on Friday after briefly receding.A border crossing between northwestern Bosnia and Croatia was closed by snow and Bosnian authorities shut down schools until Feb. 13.Heavy snow and gale-force winds also closed roads and motorways leading to Croatia's Adriatic coast.

At least four rivers have overflowed and the largest bridge in the Balkans has been destroyed due to extreme flooding in southern Albania and Greece, flooding that the Albanian prime minister has called some of the worst the country has ever seen.
The floods are Albania’s second worst on record, the Guardian reported Thursday, after speaking with prime minister Edi Rama. Hundreds of Albanian families have so far been evacuated from their homes, and no human casualties have been reported. Rama has declared a state of emergency.“What we are experiencing, not only in Albania but across Europe, gives us very considerable food for thought about climate change,” Rama reportedly told the Guardian. “There have been so many talks about it and so few real measures against it.”
Albanian police and other personnel assist a bus that slid in the water-covered road near Tepelene, 140 kilometers (80 miles) south of capital Tirana, following floods Sunday, Feb. 1, 2015. Albanian police and other personnel assist a bus that slid in the water-covered road near Tepelene, 140 kilometers (80 miles) south of capital Tirana, following floods Sunday, Feb. 1, 2015.The floods were caused by heavy rain and snow that has fallen steadily over the region in the last few days. But Rama also said man-made factors contributed to the severity of the problem — “soil erosion, deforestation and bad management of rivers,” he said. “The dam reservoirs are old and have not been maintained.” He noted that poorer Albanians in need of wood have been chopping down trees close to the country’s powerful rivers. Without them, he said, flood damage has been accelerated by soil erosion.

He said he’s hoping to help raise funds for the eastern Polish city and its surrounds.The rising river, he said, has flooded an area four kilometres by 80 kilometres in size and displaced 15,000 people in over 120 villages, though the floodwaters have yet to reach downtown Lublin. He said they’re about a 15-minute drive away.“All you see are the tips of stop signs, some rooftops,” he said. Everything else is underwater. “You see branches and tops of trees but no trunks.”Some villagers, he said, didn’t want to leave. Many of them had to be retrieved from their rooftops by rescue boats after the flood swept into their homes.“They’ve got over a thousand volunteers from all across Poland … filling sandbags.“They’re already at US$20 million just to fix the roads.

Fico also praised the work of local authorities, who probably saved thousands of lives by evacuating people promptly as the flood waters threatened. Across the country, flooding has swollen rivers and ponds to levels higher than can be measured by existing metres. Interior Minister Robert Kalinak noted that some communities which have never before experienced flooding are now facing flooding. Because they have no experience with floods, they are totally unprepared, he said. Fico warned of the likelihood that the receding waters could cause heavy damage to the country's railways and bridges. More than 3,000 troops have been deployed nationwide to support firefighters. Fico's left-wing Direction-Social Democratic party, like other competitors in the upcoming June 12 national elections, has suspended campaigning during the floods and opted to donate money earmarked for the race to flood victims. Floods have been wreaking havoc across Eastern Europe for weeks, with widespread damage stretching from Poland to Serbia

For now we are taking care of the most acute emergencies,"" he said, adding that personnel and equipment were being sent in from other parts of Sardinia and mainland Italy.Thousands were displaced by the flooding, said Environment Minister Andrea Orlando.""Around 2,700 people had to leave their homes and are staying in community shelters or with their families,"" said Orlando, speaking in front of Italy's parliament.The minister announced that an earlier death toll of 17 had risen to 18.A government meeting on Tuesday declared a state of emergency for the island and allocated 20 million euros ($27 million) for emergency assistance, while the regional government provided five million euros.A few people -- estimated at between two and four by different officials -- were still reported missing.Rescuers said that more victims could be found in flooded homes or cars and that around 20,000 people had been affected.Soldiers and navy personnel were deployed in the region, as local rescue services said their efforts were being hampered by the damage to roads. Rescue dogs were also being used, officials said.""We are focusing on essential operations: saving human lives, assisting displaced people and clearing road access,"" Prime Minister Enrico Letta told a press conference after an emergency cabinet meeting.'An absolutely extraordinary event'""This was an absolutely extraordinary event,"" Letta said, with one expert telling AFP that a storm of such intensity and with such high rainfall had not been seen on the picturesque holiday island ""for centuries"".The port city of Olbia, a popular destination in the summer months, was swept by floodwaters which receded on Tuesday, and hotels, sports halls and private homes were being used to shelter displaced people.Many local residents voiced anger saying they had not been warned sufficiently about the impending storm but the civil protection agency rejected the criticism, saying the area had been placed on red alert.The victims included four children and an entire Brazilian family of four living in a basementThree people from another family were also killed when a road bridge collapsed onto their van near Olbia, while a mother and daughter were found dead in a car that was swept away in the city by surging waters.A 64-year-old woman died in her flooded home in Uras in the southwestern part of the island, while her husband was hospitalised suffering from hypothermia.The heavy rain and high winds meanwhile shifted to the regions of Calabria and Campania in southern Italy and officials said they were monitoring the level of the River Tiber in Rome.
The holiday village of Sellia Marina in Calabria had to be evacuated, ferry services from Naples to the islands of Capri, Ischia and Procida were disrupted and St Mark's Square in Venice was under water.Silvio Saffioti, head of the fire brigade for Sardinia, said that ""many pump trucks"" to remove floodwaters were themselves stuck in flooded areas.Civil protection agency chief Franco Gabrielli said the island was ""unprepared"" for the flooding, caused by 440mm (17.3 inches) of rain in the past 24 hours alone -- almost half the amount that usually falls on average in Italy over an entire year.""I have found a lot of willingness, a bit less organisation,"" Gabrielli said after flying into Olbia, where he was overseeing rescue operations.Experts blamed unregulated construction and poor maintenance of waterways for the flooding and said the problem was all over Italy, not just Sardinia.""The area was not well managed,"" said Claudio Rafanelli, an expert on geological risks.""You cannot build in flood plains and you have to keep the rivers clear. We are really behind on this.""

(Reuters) - Three people died when their car fell off a collapsed bridge on Tuesday, as flooding battered central Italy for a third straight day, forcing part of Italy's main north-south highway to close.  Water levels were receding, however, in Venice, the lagoon city and Unesco world heritage site that at the weekend saw its sixth-worst flooding since records began in 1872.St Marks' Square, one of the lowest lying areas of the city, where some tourists were able to swim in high water on Sunday, was returning to normal, a city official said. ..The flooding alert was now centred for the area north of Rome, where officials feared the Tiber and Aniene rivers could burst their banks in low-lying areas outside the centre of the capital.The centre, however, was not expected to see damage because of high embankment walls and because the capital itself had not been hit by heavy rain for the past two days.The two men and one woman who died in Tuscany were local electricity workers. Their deaths brought the toll to four in flooding that has damaged many homes and stores as well as thousands of acres of farmland.One of the hardest hit areas was the Maremma zone of southern Tuscany, where flooding washed out many secondary roads, forced hundreds of people to leave their homes, and isolated several towns.The main A-1 highway was closed in parts of Tuscany, where it runs close to rivers.
At least four people were killed when torrential rains caused rivers to burst their banks in Italy’s province of Tuscany, news reports said on Wednesday.Two days of heavy rains also rode roughshod over the provinces of Lazio, Liguria and Umbria, causing power cuts and transport disruptions there.In another development, floods in Venice have left 70 percent of the historic port city under water.At least 3 die in floods in ItalyAccording to preliminary information, 3 people have died in central Italy as a result of flooding caused by heavy rains.According to local authorities, two men and one woman were killed when their car fell off a collapsed bridge into a river.In the regions of Umbria and Tuscany rivers burst their banks due to several days of unending rains.
Italy hit by rainsPouring rains that occurred in Italy last weekend caused landslides in several cities in the northern and central regions of the country.In some provinces the mud-stream was 1.5 metres deep. The rain destroyed several bridges, caused problems with electricity supply and locked dozens of people inside their own cars.The elements also caused serious damage to agriculture, The Corriere della Sera reports.70% percent of Venice floodedA combination of heavy rains and strong winds has led to a sharp rise in the water level in the Italian city of Venice.As a result of flooding, or ""high water"", as the locals call it, about 70 percent of the city is flooded.The city authorities have announced a state of emergency and have closed schools, other public institutions and travel routes.The city administration is urging citizens not to leave their homes and to remain on the upper floors.
In addition to Venice, other cities on the west coast of northern Italy have been hit by the unusual weather.
In the region of Tuscany emergency services have already evacuated 200 people from dangerous areas.Storms that hit northern and central Italy at the weekend caused huge damage, washing out roads and isolating towns in southern Tuscany. Four people died there, including three electric company workers whose car fell off a collapsed bridge.Farmers' lobby Coldiretti said rain, flooding and landslides in central and northern Italy may have caused up to 100 million euros in damage to agriculture.The storms whipped the Adriatic on Sunday, causing some of the worst flooding in the past 150 years in the lagoon city of Venice. St Marks's Square and other low-lying areas were under so much water that some tourists were able to swim there.Officials said the situation in Venice was returning to normal.A section of the main A-1 north-south highway that had been closed between the Lazio and Umbria regions was reopened to passenger traffic on Wednesday but still closed to heavy vehicles.",

The tiny ports of Vernazza and Monterosso, which attract hundreds of thousands of tourists a year, were swamped by hundreds of tonnes of debris and mud. The flooding and mudslides, which killed seven people in Liguria and neighbouring Tuscany, were caused by 20 inches of torrential rain falling in just a few hours on Tuesday and Wednesday. But environmentalists said its impact was made much worse by unchecked construction along the coastline, which lies east of Genoa.

During a cabinet meeting on Friday, the government in Rome declared a state of emergency for the region and released 65 million euros for the clean-up operation. Around 500 soldiers were drafted in to help with clearance efforts and to search for people still listed as missing, amid fears that the death toll could rise. The floods washed away roads and closed the railway line which connects the five villages, meaning they could only be reached by sea. Cars were piled on top of each other by the force of the water, locals and tourists had to be evacuated by sea, and villages were left without gas, electricity and water. Renata Briano, a local official, said Vernazza had been hit by ""a mountain of mud"". After flying over the area in a helicopter, Altero Mattioli, the infrastructure minister, said: ""When I was environment minister I saw many disasters, but nothing like this.

In Eidsvoll, northeast of Oslo, around 40 homeowners were told to leave their homes because of fears a dam further upslope would burst. Others were evacuated in the counties of Hedmark, Oppland, Buskerud and Telemark as officials categorized this year’s spring flooding as the worst since 1995, so far.It may get even worse, with more rain predicted and more rapid melting of snow and ice at higher elevations. Instead of beginning to melt slowly at the end of winter, this year’s unusually cold spring kept the snow and ice frozen well into May. When temperatures suddenly soared last week, the annual run-off quickly turned into the gushing torrents now threatening so many areas that emergency crews were struggling to keep up with demand.

The pumping of flooded cellars quickly became a lower priority on Wednesday as crews worked to prevent more damage by trying to divert the deluge. Roads and major highways were blocked and closed all over southern Norway, with the heavily trafficked E6 highway through Gudbrandsdalen closed in several places. The list of closed roads was so long that radio announcers on Norwegian Broadcasting (NRK) referred listeners to the state highway department’s website for the full list that was constantly being updated (external link, in Norwegian: “Stengt” means closed).

State railway NSB and railroad Jernbaneverket were also facing enormous challenges, with tracks washed out in numerous places or covered by mud- and rockslides. Main train routes through Gudbrandsdalen and Osterdalen that connect Oslo and Trondheim had to be shut down and NSB couldn’t provide alternative bus transport because adjacent roads were blocked as well. The Kongsvinger line to Oslo re-opened, however, providing some good news for commuters Thursday morning, but passengers were warned of delays throughout the day. Several long-distance truck drivers had to spend the night in or around Hamar because of highway closures that trapped them where they were, not least because their vehicles are too large to drive on the narrower secondary roads that were being used for detours. In addition to the evacuations in Eidsvoll and Kvam, around 20 homeowners were ordered to leave their homes in Nesbyen and 43 in Nord-Aurdal.

There were reports they may never be allowed to return and will be forced to rebuild in other areas because of the increased incidence of flooding in recent years. Insurance companies were launching a debate over whether other policy holders should be expected to effectively pay for the losses suffered by those who insisted on rebuilding in areas hit by floods just two years ago. Politicians are expected to tackle the issue when the immediate crisis was over."" ""Flooding forces people from homes in Norway

Hundreds of people have been evacuated from their homes after heavy rain caused flooding in southeastern Norway. In Nesbyen, a mudslide reached properties, filling some basements with water.

July 5, 2010: ""A maximum-degree flooding alert has been declared in Danubian regions of Romania, after the river level reached historical highs at a number of locations.Romanian PM Emil Boc called an emergency meeting of the cabinet to tackle the situation, commenting that Romania this week is facing “dangerous meteorological and hydrological events”.The level of the river Danube surpassed its historical highs at three cities in Eastern Romania – Feteşti, Brăila and Galati – all of them located far downstream on the Danube. The situation is most dire at Galati, where a 4.5 km levee is currently being erected with the help of gendarmes, police and volunteers.During the past days, as many as 25 people died in Romania as a result of flooding.In the Bulgarian sector, where the situation is not as grave but still critical, there have been no casualties.Sunday record levels were reported for eastern downstream Bulgarian cities of Russe and Silistra. Monday a level of 816 cm was reported for Russe, where the river flooded Port West and other facilities. The Russenski Lom river - a right tributary flowing into the Danube at Russe - also overflowed Monday.In the western Bulgarian town of Lom, where the situation has been the most critical, no change of river level (865 cm) has been reported.A drop of 4 cm has been reported by hydrological authorities at upstream western Bulgarian towns of Novo Selo and Vidin."" June 30, 2010: ""Romanian authorities have said that they are requesting aid from the European Union's Solidarity Fund following severe flooding which killed 20 people in one week and destroyed roads, crops and houses.Interior Minister Vasile Blaga said there was no assessment of the damage yet, as the situation was ongoing and still critical, especially on the Siret river in northern and eastern Romania.But he said he believed the losses would exceed 0.6% of GDP, in a country struggling with recession and with austerity measures to keep the budget deficit in check.Mr Blaga warned that the Danube had exceeded the highest levels recorded in 2006 around the towns of Galati and Braila. Thousands of people have been evacuated since Monday."" June 29, 2010: ""DOROHOI, Romania : Heavy rains caused floods that killed 21 people in Romania and thousands of others were evacuated from their homes on Tuesday as rivers threatened to burst their banks. People climbed trees to escape the rising water and many houses, roads and railway lines were destroyed or damaged by the floods, officials said. Hundreds of police and emergency workers were deployed to the rescue operation while several localities along the Danube River took urgent measures to stop it from breaching its banks. ""The situation is tragic, the damage is of a scale hard to imagine,"" Gheorghe Flutur, president of Suceava department, one of the worst hit regions, told Mediafax news agency. Twenty-one people have been confirmed dead and at least one other was missing since the floods started last week, emergency inspectorate spokesman Alin Maghiar told AFP. Nineteen died after being carried away by high waters and two others were killed by lightning, he said. Most of the deaths occurred on Monday night in two departments close from the Ukrainian border. In the northeastern town of Dorohoi, six people died in overnight Monday to Tuesday, according to officials. More than 1,700 people had to be evacuated and some scrambled up trees to avoid the water, witnesses said. 
Flooding receded on Tuesday afternoon but houses were badly damaged by the water, which rose above one metre (3.3 feet) in some places. Roads into Dorohoi remained under water. Heavy rain has fallen for much of the past week in the Balkan country and forecasters have warned that it will continue in northeastern Romania until Wednesday morning. Several old people died last week in the central regions of the country after being carried away by high waters. On Tuesday night, authorities in northeastern Neamt department ordered the evacuation of about 11,000 people along the river Siret, a Danube tributary threatening to overflow. In the northern Suceava, hundreds of people were evacuated Tuesday for the same reason. ""Ten villages have been evacuated. 1,870 people will spend the night in monasteries, schools, cultural centres or with relatives,"" a spokeswoman for the Suceava authorities told AFP. About 1,100 sheep were moved to higher ground in the mainly rural region. Further along the Siret, in Sendreni, inhabitants and emergency servicemen reinforced dykes with bags of sand to prevent floods. Prime Minister Emil Boc flew to the affected zones in northeastern Romania and said Bucharest could ask for help from an emergency European fund. Damages could amount to more than 0.6 percent of gross domestic product, Interior Minister Vasile Blaga said. - AFP/fa "" June 23, 2010: ""Romanian authorities say at last one person has died and another is missing after heavy rain and flooding in western Romania.Emergency situations spokeswoman Alina Balas says a 78-year-old woman was found dead after flooding destroyed her house in a village in Alba county.In Cluj county, emergency situations chief Vasile Somlea says a 23-year-old man is missing and feared dead.Hundreds of houses have been inundated by the flooding, which began Monday. Authorities have evacuated hundreds of people.On Wednesday, authorities are on alert in parts of northern Romania as water levels rose in the Prut river on the border with Moldova.""

Boats ferried residents to safety from St Helen's in Lancashire and Morpeth in Northumberland, where defences installed after disastrous flooding in 2008 failed to contain the river Wansbeck.

Transport was devastated as parts of the M6 and the East Coast main line became temporary rivers, and swirling underground water left a block of town houses in Newburn, Newcastle, seemingly on stilts as earth round the foundations was swept away. Police cordoned off the building amid fears it could collapse and last night the area around it was said to be like a ""ghost town"" after a power failure.

An old fishing village in the Footdee or ""Fittie"" area of Aberdeen was covered in a white foam as wind and rain drove a thick froth of plankton and sea-spume inland. The city council said the coating was ""unusual but harmless"" and it would be swept up by environmental teams if any was left after the rain.

An easing of the downpour in the central Pennines, turning to a fine mist by mid-afternoon on Tuesday, saved the centre of Leeds and the much-flooded Calder valley town of Hebden Bridge from serious damage. Sandbags were everywhere in Hebden Bridge and pumps on standby, while emergency teams from the Environment Agency in Leeds ran a round-the-clock clearing of drains and watercourses.

The agency warned, however, that further flooding was likely in Yorkshire, the north-west and north Wales overnight before the obstinate centre of low pressure finally crept off the fells and turned its attention to the Midlands and south. The Meteorological Office warned that their turn would be on Wednesday as the weather backtracked down the course it took over the weekend. There are 219 flood warnings in place.

The yo-yo pattern is the result of two weather systems – a warm front from the Atlantic and a colder one drawn from north of Scotland meeting – and dumping persistent rain. Although some areas have experienced gusts of up to 70mph, the reluctance of the dismal weather to move off north and east is also due to a weaker jetstream than usual at this time of the year.

The Environment Agency has notified 75,000 properties of the serious risk of flooding since Sunday, but in spite of the failure at Morpeth – whose recovery was used as a model for Cockermouth when the Cumbrian town was ravaged by floods three years ago – defences held up well at Ripon, Tadcaster, Dewsbury, Appleby-in-Westmorland and other former trouble spots.

Police said there was a “serious danger” of injury and asked people to avoid driving through the county.The floods come at a delicate time for the government, as only weeks ago it reneged on promises to protect flood defences from spending cuts. At least one big flood scheme – a £100m plan to protect Leeds – is likely to be scrapped, the Financial Times has revealed, with dozens of others under review.The budget for new defences and upgrading existing ones has been cut from £335m a year to £261m each year for the next four years.

Flood water from a nearby turlough had invaded the house to a depth of four inches, but that had receded earlier in the week.A placid lake had settled round his remote thatched house and the dwelling of his mother-in-law next door in Grannagh, in south Galway.Access to Willers’ house was by tractor only and his front garden looked like a swimming pool. Willers and his wife Bridie, a Fine Gael county councillor, began the clean-up as soon as the water level dropped below the house’s front door.The sodden floorboards near the front were the first to go — water had seeped up through them “like a scene from Titanic”. But Willers was puzzled by the puddle that kept reforming on the seemingly impermeable kitchen tiles — until he noticed the trickle from an unplugged fridge-freezer, which had been hoisted on to a table along with other appliances and valuables.“I was so worried that water was seeping in from somewhere outside that I missed the obvious one,” said Willers, a softly spoken Englishman.The couple are among hundreds of stressed households dealing with the aftermath of the worst floods in Ireland in living memory. As with many of the estimated 1,500 people who have been forced to evacuate their homes, neighbours stepped in to help. The family have been lent an empty house within a mile of their home until they can return.Around the country, charities, families, neighbours and organisations such as the Irish Farmers’ Association (IFA) have been to the fore in helping flood victims.Tom Clonan, a retired army captain, spoke for many of those affected when he described the government’s response as “lamentable”.On The Frontline on RTE1 last Monday, to loud applause, Clonan told John Gormley, the environment minister, that the lack of army assistance for people in flooded areas was a clear government failure.As the waters slowly recede and the cost of the damage becomes apparent, the government’s management of Ireland’s waterways and its response to the floods is increasingly being questioned"" December 3,2009: Roads in Fermanagh were under water yesterday as torrential rainfall brought renewed flooding chaos to the county. Heavy downpours have left vast areas saturated, and yesterday three main roads remained impassable by car after more downpours. At Lough Erne, which was at its highest recorded level last Friday, the water has dropped by less than a foot in the last five days. People are still using tractors and jeeps to commute to work and take children to school. According to Roads Service, parts of the B127 Newbridge Road, the B533 Wattlebridge Road at Derrykerrib and C436 Inishmore Road could not be passed by cars yesterday. Minor roads under water included the Derrychara Link near Enniskillen and Glenasheevar Road at Beagh. In Lisnaskea the Rossmacole Road, Kinmore Road, Drumcon Road, Rossmacaffrey Road, Kilmore Road and Derryadd Road were also badly affected.Meanwhile in Newtownbutler the Ballyhoe Road and Inver Road were also under water. Many people in the county are still suffering the aftermath of the floods. They include Tom Leonard, who runs a marine business at Carrybridge near Lisbellaw. His workshop was flooded and it could be several weeks before he is back to normal. “This is likely to leave us out of pocket. It is the people on the ground like us who have been left to pick up the pieces,” he said. The North's First Minister Peter Robinson visited three of the flood-hit areas during a visit to Fermanagh at the weekend, and he is due to raise the issue at today’s Executive meeting. A telephone conference is also being held by representatives from Fermanagh council and the Rivers Agency and Roads Service to discuss how to deal with the flooding. ""November 22, 2009: ""Clean-up efforts are underway in flood-hit towns following the heaviest downpours ever recorded in England, as fears mount for a woman missing near a swollen river in Wales.About 314mm of rain fell in 24 hours - the highest level since records began - over Cumbria as torrential rains swept across Britain and Ireland.The Environment Agency said 65 flood warnings are in force across England and Wales, with four severe warnings in Cumbria in northwest England, the area hardest hit.About 60 people were still sheltering in reception centres on Sunday and more than 700 properties remained without power.An urgent safety review of Cumbria's 1,800 bridges was underway, with emergency services warning one bridge in the coastal town of Workington could collapse at any time.The Calva Bridge's closure cut off the north side of the town.Workington's other bridge has collapsed, taking the life of a policeman who was diverting motorists away from it on Friday.Tony Cunningham, member of parliament for Workington, said: ""We have concerns about people who have not got prescriptions, medication, the medical centre is down to its last nappies for babies.The floods in Cumbria and southern Scotland are expected to trigger insurance claims of up to STG100 million ($A181.21 million), the Association of British Insurers said.Meanwhile a search is underway for a woman believed to have been swept away by the River Usk in Brecon, south Wales, late on Saturday. The river is under flood watch.Prime Minister Gordon Brown surveyed the grim aftermath on a visit on Saturday to the badly hit Cumbria town of Cockermouth, with houses filled with muddy water, silt and sludge carpeting the roads and cars left awkwardly where the floods left them.Cockermouth town centre was cordoned off as surveyors, structural engineers, utility workers and Environment Agency staff continued work to start the clean-up."" ...""Ireland battled floods on Saturday described as a ""once in 800 years event"", with the government rushing to provide shelter and drinking water and soldiers sent to assist those affected. Rivers burst their banks, coastal towns were threatened by sea flooding, 18,000 households were left without water in Cork, Ireland's second city -- and forecasters warned of more heavy rain to come.""We have been told this is a once in 800 years event. We have had no fatalities and that is a blessing,"" Environment Minister John Gormley told RTE state radio as he toured some of the worst hit areas.Prime Minister Brian Cowen chaired a meeting of the national emergency coordination committee, and said the main concern was to help people evacuated from their homes and to maintain water supplies.""Clearly we are very concerned about maintaining the priority of helping those who have been displaced or have to be looked after in accommodation. Also making sure that people have access to clean drinking water,"" he said.""There is also a situation where major installations have to be protected, hospitals for example.""Troops were drafted in to assist emergency services in the worst hit areas, particularly Cork in the south and towns in the south, midlands and west of the republic, as forecasters predicted more heavy rain to come.In Cork where the River Lee burst its banks, RTE reported that 18,000 homes had their water cut off following extensive damage to the city's main pumping station, and said it was unlikely to be restored for at least a week....In Galway to the west, local authorities warned flood waters were still rising and urged motorists to avoid travelling, amid widespread road closures.Thousands of hectares of farmland were submerged and the Irish Farmers Association warned of severe economic repercussions.The Meteorological Office has issued a weather alert and warned of severe gales. It said its stations at Sherkin Island, County Cork and Claremorris, County Mayo in the west have already had more rain than in any previous full November. Meteorologist Gerry Fleming added: ""The run of wet summers and wet winters we been having in the last two years are unprecedented."" November 20, 2009: ""Parts of Scotland and northern England were under several feet of water Friday morning after raging rivers burst their banks and flooded towns, officials said.A police officer was missing after flooding in Cumbria, near the border with Scotland, Cumbria police said Friday. An earlier report that 11 people were missing was incorrect, a police spokesman said.The Cumbria town of Cockermouth was one of the worst hit. The Georgian market town sits at the junction of two rivers, the Cocker and the Derwent, which raged overnight and flooded the town center.The waters were so strong at times that rescuers could not send their boats against the flow to reach trapped residents, witnesses said.Two bridges in Workington, about seven miles east of Cockermouth, collapsed because of the floods, Cumbria police said. Engineers are trying to assess bridges for structural damage, though the work is difficult while the waters remain high, police said.Witnesses said the nearby town of Keswick, about 10 miles to the southeast of Cockermouth, was also badly hit.The Fire Service and Royal Air Force evacuated about 200 people by helicopter from Cockermouth's main street and town square, both cut off by the floodwaters, Cumbria police said.Police advised against all non-essential travel in Cumbria because many roads are closed and impassable.Several reception centers were set up at schools and leisure centers for residents forced from their homes, the police said.British Prime Minister Gordon Brown spoke with Cumbria's chief constable Friday morning and promised him any government help he needs, Brown's office at Downing Street said.""His thoughts are with all those who have been impacted by the floods and our thanks go to the emergency services, who continue their extraordinary efforts to help those affected,"" a statement from his office said.Environment Secretary Hilary Benn was in Cumbria on Friday to assess a government response, Downing Street said.There were no deaths reported from the floods, which began Thursday after heavy rain swept over the region.One of the largest recorded totals was in Seathwaite, about 20 miles south of Cockermouth, known for being one of the wettest places in the United Kingdom. About 14.6 inches (372 millimeters) of rain fell there between Wednesday night and 4 a.m. Friday (11 p.m. ET Thursday), said forecaster Robin Thwaytes of the Met Office weather service.""It's a phenomenal amount of rain to come down in such a short period of time,"" he said.Bad weather was forecast to continue across the United Kingdom over the next few days, with more heavy rain and gale-force winds bringing the continued risk of flooding, the Met Office said...""Raging floods engulfed northern England's picturesque Lake District on Friday following the heaviest rainfall ever recorded in Britain, killing a police officer and trapping dozens in their swamped homes.Military helicopters winched dozens of people to safety and emergency workers in bright orange inflatable boats rescued scores more after an unprecedented deluge.British soldiers conducted house-to-house searches for those trapped by floods as deep as 8 feet (2.5 meters). Troops also dropped down on lines from Royal Air Force helicopters, breaking through rooftops to pluck people to safety.Constable Bill Barker, 44, died as he joined rescue attempts, swept into the surging waters when a major bridge collapsed. Emergency services said more than 200 people were rescued in the hardest-hit town, Cockermouth and about 1,000 homes were flooded.In a message to local officials, Queen Elizabeth II said she was ""deeply concerned and saddened by the dreadful flooding across Britain."" British Prime Minister Gordon Brown said Barker ""was a very heroic, very brave man.""Britain's Met Office said a record 12.3 inches (314.4 millimeter) of rain fell in 24 hours in the area - the heaviest rainfall ever recorded in the U.K.Cockermouth, a market town 330 miles (530 kilometers) northwest of London, lies at the junction of the Cocker and Derwent rivers and is known as the birthplace of poet William Wordsworth. The flood was ""of biblical proportions,"" local House of Commons lawmaker Tony Cunningham said.Heavy rain and gales also brought widespread flooding to Ireland, as more than 3 feet (1 meter) of water shut down the center of the country's second-largest city, Cork, and more than a dozen towns and villages. The Irish army was used to rescue the stranded from waist-deep floodwaters and a helicopter winched to safety a County Galway family of five, including the 87-year-old grandmother.Floods caused transport chaos along Ireland's western coast. At the Lake Hotel, on the shores of the fabled Killarney Lakes in County Kerry, about 170 guests at the Victorian period building were evacuated by tractor, as staff carried period furniture upstairs.Irish weather forecasting service Met Eireann said parts of southern and western Ireland suffered their most intense and sustained rainfall in 30 years

But flood defences and evacuation warnings meant that only two people were killed in storm-related accidents.Accidents linked to the storm that roared across Europe have killed at least eight people, from Britain to Sweden, Denmark and Poland.Traffic ground to a halt on icy highways and train service was cancelled in large parts of Sweden. Tens of thousands of people lost electricity. Strong winds knocked down the city of Vaxjo's Christmas tree.Scores of flights were cancelled at airports in Sweden, Denmark, Norway, Germany and Poland. More than 1000 people spent the night at Copenhagen Airport where 200 flights were cancelled Thursday and about 70 on Friday.Strong winds threatened a collection of Viking ships recovered from the bottom of a Danish fjord in the 1960s and put on exhibition.Museum workers boarded up the expansive windows of the Viking Ship Museum in Roskilde, west of Copenhagen, amid fears water from the fjord would rise and shatter the glass.Police in Denmark ordered the evacuation of people in the towns of Frederikssund and Frederiksvaerk, northeast of Copenhagen, because of imminent flooding. The towns lie on the Roskilde fjord, which has seen water levels rise noticeably.Hamburg Airport, where almost all flights were cancelled on Friday, was open for business but cautioned that there would be cancellations because of wind and snow.Trains northward from Hamburg to Denmark and some other destinations were cancelled.Tidal floods that hit Hamburg in the early morning were akin to those that drenched the city in 1962, causing the worst flooding in living memory. But higher and better coastal defences along the North Sea these days have meant the impact of this week's storm on the city has been negligible, with no reports of major damage or loss of life.Meanwhile, wind farms in Germany reaped benefits from the storm. The country's vast network of on- and offshore wind turbines produced 25,205.8 MW of electricity, the equivalent of 25 nuclear plants and almost 35 per cent of the country's total energy output in one hour""  Some flooding in Rotterdam, Dordrecht as storm clean-up begins. December 6, 2013: ""A number of streets close to the river in Rotterdam and Dordrecht have been flooded following the combination of strong winds and high tides, according to media reports on Friday.The water is up to knee-high in parts of Rotterdam close to the rivers and areas of Dordrecht's historic centre are under water. There are also reports of localised flooding in nearby Maasluis.A temporary dyke on the Oude Maas river under the Botlekbrug broke through over a three-metre stretch on Friday morning, leading to traffic diversions. The dyke had been built because of roadworks on the bridge.In Zeeland, the water level along the main sea dykes reached 3.99 metres above normal, the highest recorded since the great storm of 1953 which killed nearly two thousand people.Weather forecasters say winds remain strong in coastal areas and there will localised snow and hail showers at times.The emergency services received 2,700 calls about damage during the height of the storm, as it moved over the Netherlands between 16.00 and 20.00 hours. In total, over 3,700 damage reports were made by 23.00 hours.

High tides and severe weather led to 25 people being taken from complexes at Stonehaven in Aberdeenshire.
They were taken to St Bridget’s Hall in the town, where a rest centre was set up.
Further north at Peterhead, about 30 people were evacuated from properties in the Roanheads area.
Some stayed with friends while others were given accommodation at a hotel, according to Aberdeenshire Council.
People at a care home in Huntly, which sits inland at the River Deveron, were told to prepare to leave but later given the all clear.
Willie Munro, of Aberdeenshire Council, said: “Trained council staff and emergency services personnel are on hand at St Bridget’s Hall to provide support for the people who have been evacuated.
“High tide in Stonehaven has passed and, while we continue to monitor the levels of the River Carron closely, there are currently no concerns that the river will flood.”
Authorities took the action because of unusually high waters, which also affected other parts of Scotland.
In Wick, on the far north coast, roads were closed and fishing boats were damaged in high winds.
About 12 cars were moved from a car park when a strong surge breached a river bank, police said.
Several roads were closed by debris thrown up by the waves. ""November 29, 2012:""  Floods in England and Wales have killed four people, brought misery to hundreds of home, and seriously disrupted travel and business as the torrential rain heads towards the North Sea.The body of an elderly woman, the fourth victim to the torrential rain, was recovered by firefighters in the city of St Asaph on Tuesday from her flooded house, local media reported.The current wet weather has followed the wettest April and June on record in all parts of Britain.Despite the British government's effort to fund many flood prevention initiatives since the Second World War, flooding seems to have hit the headlines more than it did only a couple of decades ago.""I think it is a combination of climate change and development ... Whether it's man-made global warming or whatever, the climate is changing, and we are having more extreme weather patterns,"" said Mike Tavener, flood risk manager of the Council of York City in northern England, where river waters rose to record levels this year.Paul Copping, chief executive of the Flood Defense Forum, a nationwide charity focused on tackling the dangers of flooding also said Britain was now getting more violent bursts of rain than in the past as a result of climate change.""Because weather patterns have changed, places that weren't at risk in the past now are at risk,"" he said.""Over the past 20 years the number of insurance claims as a result of surface water flooding has gone up significantly,"" he added.Sitting at the point where the Rivers Nidd, Foss, Swale and Ure join to form the River Ouse, the York city has always been threatened by the danger of flooding after heavy rainfalls, wet spells or snow, as the swollen rivers run to the sea...November 27, 2012: ""Prime Minister David Cameron is visiting flood-hit areas as many parts of the country struggle to deal with rising water levels in the wake of heavy rainfall.With 227 flood alerts and 183 flood warnings in place across England and Wales, the Environment Agency has urged many communities - in the north east of England, North Wales and Northamptonshire in particular - to remain vigilant.On the roads, there was disruption for thousands of drivers, while train services were subject to hold-ups in the West Country. The North East also experienced rail problems, with buses having to replace trains on some routes. Meanwhile, councils have placed thousands of tonnes of sandbags, water pumps and emergency accommodation at the ready.
